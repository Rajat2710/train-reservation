Hi,
I have creted this simple application

Url - https://train-reservation-ec583.web.app/
This is hosted on firebase

Assumptions
1. Here on opening webpage it will randomly select 50 reserved seats coloured in red
2. you can enter no from 1-7 and it will reserved seat for the user coloured in purple.
3. Here i didn,t create any database or api yet as i didn,t get the problem fully where i can use db and api.

The most imortant thing is you have to refresh the page everytime you want to enter an input so that it will randomly
select 50 numbers again.

It is just for showing the logic for reservation.

If you can give me more detail. I will then create database and api endpoints accordingly.
